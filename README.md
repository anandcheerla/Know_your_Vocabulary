# Subtitle_Vocabulary_Generator
It generates the vocabulary words and meanings by segregating the non naive words from the file.

The segregation is based on the following rules

1)words with length of two characters are ommitted
2)stop words(naive and mostly used word like he,she,there) are omitted
3)prepositions,conjunctions and pronouns are omitted
4)frequency of a word that is greater than 10 are ommitted,those words may indicate straight forward words

---yet to figure of any other rules





meanings:
right now it fetches all sorts of meanings

yet to implement  -  there should be a way where we can segregate based on the word that is used in particular sentence or situtaion
