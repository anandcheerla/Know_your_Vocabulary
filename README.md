# Know your Vocabulary
It generates the vocabulary words and meanings by segregating the non naive words from the file.

The segregation is based on the following rules

1)words with length of two characters are ommitted
2)stop words(naive and mostly used word like he,she,there) are omitted
3)prepositions,conjunctions and pronouns are omitted
4)frequency of a word that is greater than 10 are ommitted,those words may indicate straight forward words
